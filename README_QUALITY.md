## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Recommended Regular Execution

```bash
# Recommended weekly quality check execution
# Add to crontab:
# 0 2 * * 1 /path/to/gcpclosecheck/scripts/quality-check.sh
```

### 2. Quality Improvement Workflow

1. **Analysis Execution**: Understand current state with `scripts/quality-check.sh`
2. **Issue Identification**: Check reports in `reports/` directory
3. **Automatic Fixes**: Resolve fixable issues with `scripts/fix-issues.sh`
4. **Manual Fixes**: Address remaining issues in priority order
5. **Effect Measurement**: Confirm improvement effects with `scripts/track-progress.sh`

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Integration

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Quality Check
  run: |
    chmod +x scripts/quality-check.sh
    scripts/quality-check.sh --test
```

### 4. Report Utilization Methods

- **Developers**: Check technical details in `reports/detailed_report.md`
- **Managers**: Understand overall situation with `reports/executive_summary.md`
- **Continuous Improvement**: Track improvement trends with `reports/trend_analysis.md`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. golangci-lint Configuration Error

**Error Example:**
```
Error: can't load config: unsupported version of the configuration
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Update .golangci.yml
golangci-lint --version  # Check version
# Update to latest configuration format
```

#### 2. Mass Test Failures

**Solution Approach:**
1. Check failure causes in `reports/failed_tests_detail.txt`
2. Check for dependency issues: `go mod tidy`
3. Execute gradual test fixes

#### 3. Memory Shortage Error

**Solution:**
```bash
# For large projects, reduce parallelism
# Adjust MAX_PARALLEL_JOBS in scripts/quality-check.sh
```

#### 4. Unable to Obtain Coverage

**Check Items:**
- Do test files exist?
- Is go.mod configuration correct?
- Are tests actually executing?

### Known Issues

#### 1. GCP Library Dependency Errors

Some tests may encounter GCP client library import errors.

**Workaround:**
```bash
# Install necessary GCP libraries
go mod download cloud.google.com/go/...
```

#### 2. macOS date Command Compatibility

The date command behavior may differ between macOS and Linux.

**Already Addressed:**
The scripts automatically detect the environment and use appropriate commands.

## üìä Operations Guide

### Operational Process for Continuous Quality Improvement

#### 1. Daily Monitoring

```bash
# For development teams: Daily quality checks
scripts/quality-check.sh --test
```

#### 2. Weekly Quality Review

```bash
# Full analysis and history comparison
scripts/quality-check.sh
scripts/track-progress.sh
```

#### 3. Monthly Quality Assessment

1. Create and share detailed reports
2. Quality metrics trend analysis
3. Review improvement plans

### Quality Gate Criteria

The following criteria are recommended:

- **Test Coverage**: 80% or higher
- **Test Failures**: 0 failures
- **Security Issues**: 0 issues
- **Critical Lint Issues**: 0 issues

### Maintenance

#### Regular Maintenance Tasks

```bash
# Weekly cleanup
scripts/cleanup.sh

# Monthly setup verification
scripts/setup.sh --verify
```

#### Log and Report Management

- Reports are automatically rotated
- Reports older than 30 days are automatically deleted
- History data is permanently stored in `reports/history/`

## üîÑ Update Guide

### Tool Updates

```bash
# Update Go toolchain
mise install go@latest

# Update golangci-lint
golangci-lint --version
# Install latest version
```

### Configuration Updates

- `.golangci.yml`: Adjust static analysis rules
- `scripts/utils.sh`: Change common settings
- `scripts/quality-check.sh`: Adjust execution parameters

## üìà Understanding Quality Metrics

### Overall Quality Score Calculation Method

```
Overall Quality Score = Test Coverage(%) - (Failed Tests √ó 2) - (Lint Issues √∑ 2) - (Security Issues √ó 10)
```

### Recommended Improvement Order

1. **Security Issues** (Highest Priority): Fix immediately
2. **Test Failures**: Fix before release
3. **Coverage Deficiency**: Continuous improvement
4. **Lint Issues**: Fix in next release
